# predictive-detection-engineering

This repository focuses on **predictive detection engineering**: detection content and methods that use trends, sequences, behavioral baselines, and forecasting to identify **likely upcoming security events** and **early-stage attack progression**, not only confirmed malicious activity.

## Goals
- Normalize public detection content across ecosystems
- Create a taxonomy of detection patterns and “predictive readiness”
- Publish predictive-first detections with validation guidance
- Provide evaluation methods (backtesting, drift, tuning) suitable for SOC operations

## What this repo includes
- Detection standards and schemas (YAML-first)
- Source inventory (public detection corpora)
- Templates for consistent detection authoring
- Predictive detection patterns and examples

## What this repo does not do
- Trigger alerts based solely on LLM output
- Distribute proprietary vendor detection logic

## Status
Early build. Structure and content will evolve quickly.
