false_positives:
  - Network discovery tooling during vulnerability scans.
  - New system deployments or patch windows that increase east-west traffic.
  - Backup, monitoring, or management systems contacting many internal hosts.

triage:
  - Confirm host role and recent change activity (patching, deployment, scanning).
  - Review top internal destinations and whether they are new for this host.
  - Check for authentication anomalies from the same host within the observation window.
  - Identify processes or users associated with the connections if telemetry exists.

tuning:
  - Increase deviation ratio to 3.0 in noisy environments.
  - Increase sustained buckets to 4 or 5 to reduce bursty behavior.
  - Replace new_internal_targets proxy with true novelty using a 30-day destination set lookup or summary index.
  - Exclude known scanners and management hosts by allowlist.
